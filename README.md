This ROS message package was extracted from the
[prophesee_ros_wrapper repository of Prophesee](https://github.com/prophesee-ai/prophesee_ros_wrapper) and as such inherits the Apache 2 license from its parent repository.

This package will compile into ROS1 under ``catkin build`` or ROS2
using ``colcon build``, provided the environment variable
``ROS_VERSION`` is set correctly.
